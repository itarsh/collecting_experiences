                The Sublime Forest
            </h2>
            <p>
                Artist Mariele Neudecker has filled rooms with life-sized casts of trees, produced full-scale models of tracts of wild woodland, and often includes trees, both alive and dead, in her films.
                Her ‘tank works’, which have featured submerged forests based on those depicted in European Romantic painting, appear like three-dimensional micro-worlds, at once natural and artificial, real and fictional.

                <p>
                    This major retrospective is the first Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern for almost 20 years. 
                    As well as his iconic pop images of Marilyn Monroe, Coca-Cola and Campbell’s soup cans, it includes works never seen before in the UK. 
                    Twenty-five works from his Ladies and Gentlemen series – portraits of black and Latinx drag queens and trans women – are shown for the first time in 30 years.
