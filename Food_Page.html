        Restaurants, Cafes, and Foodie Spots with a feminist point of view
    </h2>

    <div class="intro_text">
    <p>
        When looking for food in London, the choice can be overwhelming.
        Over the course of a lifetime you wouldn't be able to do every London food experience, and new spots open everyday.
    <br>
        Because you're a busy, incredible, kick-ass woman who doesn't necessarily have time to find the next hotspot, we've got some recommendations for you below. 
        All the recommendations have a woman at the core, whether as the chef, owner, or restaurateur, to provide a feminist food experience.

            <h2>
                Bao
            </h2>
            <p>
                The original Bao opened in 2015 in Soho, but before that the team was steaming buns as a market stall in East London.
                Now with four locations, you can find their delicious and fluffy, but well-priced buns across London.
                The women at the heart of this enterprise are Erchen Chang and Wait Ting Chung, who co-founded Bao when it was just a market stall with their business partner Shing Tat Chung.
                <br>
                <br>
                Must try dishes: the classic BAO, or beef short rib. Namesake dishes are always the way to go

                    Oklava
                </h2>

                <p>
                    With a second location recently opened the Great British Menu alumna Selim Kiazim is hitting new heights.
                    Her restaurant Oklava (and it's bakery spin-off) are bringing a whole new style of Turkish food to London's eating scene, very different from your local kebab shop fare.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Must try dish: on the bakery menu is a Black sea cheese & Butter pide, and in my opinion Turkish pide bread is something everyone should know about and eat as often as possible.

                <p>
                    While there are many next level experiences with women at the helm (Nieves Barrágan Mohacho of Barrafina comes to mind), this is a slightly less well-known option, but no less impressive. 
                    Head Chef Ruth Hansom is only 24, but has 5 years experience at The Ritz under her belt, and was the first winner of the Young National Chef of the Year competition in 2017.
                    Now at Pomona's she is crafting seasonal fair with sustainability at the core of what the restaurant offers.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Must try dish: At £60 per head it feels amiss not to try the 4-course seasonal tasting menu, which is made up of 2 sharing dishes per course.

        CORE by Clare Smyth
    </h3>

    <p>
        Is it any surprise that when putting together a list of female-led London food ventures Clare Smyth should feature?
        Completely at the top of her game, and a standout in the fine dining industry, Smyth received the World's Best Female Chef Award from the World's 50 Best Restaurants, and gained 2 Michlin stars in her first year of opening CORE.
        This Notting Hill spot is a must for any foodie looking to be blown away (and a bill that will do the same!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Must try dish: Once again, I'm cheating by telling you to just do the tasting menu, because you will regret it if you don't.
