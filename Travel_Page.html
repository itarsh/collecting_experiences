                    Discover what life was like for women at the dawn of the 20th century and how their position in society began to change. Follow in the footsteps of Emmeline Pankhurst, Mary ‘Slasher’ Richardson and the wave of Suffragettes who campaigned tirelessly for women’s rights. Remember the actions of ordinary women who lived their lives differently to the generations before them, shaping society through small acts of rebellion, such as joining the workforce.
